# Sruthi Co PES

Simulating the potential energy surface of a nucleus requires heavy calculations.
The present code aims at using active learning in order to reduce the computation time.

## Principle

Some points are asked to be simulated by the algorithm and the rest of the surface is computed using a committee of neural networks.

## Usage

You will find in src/active_learning.py a code ready to use with many inputs to choose from.
It generates a committee of neural networks and then trains itself generating data from the barrier code.
The committee can then be accessed using Keras' models/load_model as shown in final_analysis.py

The inputs allows for the customization of many aspect, such as the initial training dataset,
the frame from which the new points are generated, the hyperparameters of the committee's neural
networks and of the training, the way in which the new points are chosen and how the training
data is splitted between the commitee's model.

The initial training dataset is generated by a grid in the epsilon, alpha3 space, defined by
*epsilon_range* and *alpha_range*. The new points are them generated from a grid using the same
min and max values of epsilon and alpha, but many more steps (*empty_grid_size* steps).
The training stops when the maximal variance over this grid reaches *goal_variance* or when
the total number of epochs reaches *epoch_max*.
A committee of *n_models* neural networks of shape *model_shape* is generated
